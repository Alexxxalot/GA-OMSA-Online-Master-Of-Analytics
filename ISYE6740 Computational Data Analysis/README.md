# FA2020: ISYE6740 Computational Data Analysis/Machine Learning
 
[Syllabus](https://github.com/Alexxxalot/GA-OMSA-Online-Master-Of-Analytics/blob/main/ISYE6740%20Computational%20Data%20Analysis/OMSA6740-Fall%202020-Xie-Syllabus-3.pdf)

### Course Description
Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. The course is designed to answer the most fundamental questions about machine learning: What are the most important methods to know about, and why? How can we answer the questions such as “is this method better than that one' using asymptotic theory”? How can we answer the question 'is this method better than that one' for a specific dataset of interest? What can we say about the errors our method will make on future data? What's the “right” objective function? How to tune parameters? What does it mean to be statistically rigorous?  
This course is designed to give graduate students a thorough grounding in the methods, theory, mathematics and algorithms needed to do research and applications in machine learning. The course covers topics from machine learning, classical statistics, and data mining. Students entering the class with a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics and algorithms will be at an advantage, but the class has been designed so that anyone with a strong numerate background can catch up and fully participate. Some experience with coding is expected (Python, or MATLAB.)
